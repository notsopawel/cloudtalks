## Action plan
1. Create 3xEC2 instances, with different names(tag) and instance types.
2. Parametrize Name tag value and instance type.
3. Prepare the code in the way that the same codebase might be used by different environments.
4. Follow the process that code should be placed on dedicated branch, approved and merged to the main.
5. Update README file status.




## Status
- [ ] EC2 instances;
