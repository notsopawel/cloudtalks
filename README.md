## Action plan
1. Create 3xEC2 instances, with different names(tag) and instance types.
2. Parametrize "Name" tag value and instance type.
3. Prepare the code as a module so that different environments might use the same codebase.
4. Follow the process that code should be placed on a dedicated branch, approved, and merged to the main branch.
5. Update README file status and howto section.

## Status
- [ ] EC2 instances;
- [ ] Branch&PR;
- [ ] Environments separation;


## HowTo
Please provide example module usage with links to the applied resources documentation.
